1. Prompt user for the Height(must be an integer).

2. Check if the input is between 1 and 8, inclusive.
    if not, then start from step 1.

3. Loop through 0 to Height twice, for rows of the pyramid and
    columns of each of those rows.

4 For each row loop(top to bottom),
    make two consecutive column loops(left to right) to create one
    column in such a way that one part of the column is ' '
    and other is '#' by keeping track of the counter
